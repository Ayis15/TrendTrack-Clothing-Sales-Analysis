# TrendTrack-Clothing-Sales-Analysis

1. Managing customer and seller information  
2. Tracking product inventory by seller  
3. Adding products to carts and managing purchases  
4. Recording payments and generating purchase history  
5. Tracking shipments between customers and sellers  
6. Generating insights like top-selling products, monthly sales trends, and customer purchase reports
